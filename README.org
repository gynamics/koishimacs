Prepare to lose your mind in Emacs!

* About
My personal Emacs configuration.

Read [[file:koishimacs.org::*preface][koishimacs.org:Prelude:preface]] if you are interested in my ideas.

* Features
- A sweet logo (handdrawn, original character by /Team Shanghai Alice/)
- A minimal literate startup framework, all in one org document.
- Quick deployment (see [[*Bootstrap][Bootstrap]]).
- Use both ~package.el~ and ~el-get.el~ for package fetching.
- Out of the box as a powerful text editor, IDE or org editor.
- Comes with unicode font GUI configuration (especially Chinese).
- Starts up fast, GUI starts up in no more than 2 second on a modern machine.
- Even faster in terminal.
- Configured as a multi-frame editor when working in daemon mode.

* Bootstrap
1. First, make sure that your network is smooth, and clone this repository.

   #+begin_src sh
     git clone https://github.com/gynamics/koishimacs
   #+end_src

2. Please at least have a look at [[file:init.el][init.el:package-archives]] and section [[file:koishimacs.org::*environment][koishimacs.org:Prelude:environment]] to get ~ELPA~ mirror urls, ~PATH~, ~http_proxy~ and other environment variables configured correctly.

   You may also want to configure ~org-directory~ and ~org-roam-directory~ at the same time, just search and modify these ~:custom~ cells in section [[file:koishimacs.org::*Org Editor][koishimacs.org:Org Editor]], it is not a difficult task.

   You can remove unwanted blocks easily by add ~:tangle no~ to it, or simply delete one ~use-package~ block. After all, ~git~ records it for you.

3. Then, copy it to ~$HOME/.config/emacs~ or ~$HOME/.emacs.d~ to replace your old ~user-emacs-directory~.

   #+begin_src sh
     mv ~/.config/emacs ~/.config/emacs-backup # backup your previous config
     cp -r koishimacs ~/.config/emacs
   #+end_src

4. Now simply start your emacs, wait for about 3 to 5 minutes for package installation.

5. Finally, do remaining steps to complete the installation. There is an untangled block at [[file:koishimacs.org::*postscript][koishimacs.org:postscript]] that does these things.

- There may be some external program dependencies, like ~ripgrep~, ~global~ or ~curl~. Most of them are not necessary for basic usage, install them on yourselves if you need.
- [[https://www.nerdfonts.com][nerd-fonts]] is highly recommended for display various icons. ~Symbols Nerd Font~ covers most unicode icons used. As for Chinese font, the default Chinese font I use is ~LXGW Wenkai Mono~.

* Maintenance
The mainline code will keep updating on my personal taste, fork it if you could be inspired, to some degree. Do *NOT* pull it, it is not meant to have a contiguous integration process.

Feel free to discuss with me in Issues or E-mail, I am also active on EmacsChina Forum, recently.
