Prepare to lose your mind in Emacs!

* About
My personal Emacs configuration.

Read [[file:koishimacs.org::*preface][koishimacs.org:Prelude:preface]] if you are interested in my ideas.

* Features
- A sweet logo (hand-drawn, original character by /Team Shanghai Alice/)
- A sweet theme ([[https://github.com/gynamics/koishi-theme.el][koishi-theme]] designed by gynamics)
- A minimal literate startup framework, all in one org document.
- Quick deployment (see [[*Bootstrap][Bootstrap]]).
- Use built-in ~package.el~ for package fetching and management.
- Out of the box as a powerful text editor, IDE or org editor.
- Comes with Unicode font GUI configuration (especially Chinese).
- Starts up fast, GUI starts up in no more than 2 seconds on a modern machine.
- Even faster in terminal.
- Configured as a multi-frame editor when working in daemon mode.

* Bootstrap
1. First, make sure that your network is smooth, and clone this repository.

   #+begin_src sh
     git clone https://github.com/gynamics/koishimacs
   #+end_src

2. Please at least have a look at [[file:koishimacs.org::*package manager][koishimacs.org:Prelude:package manager]] and section [[file:koishimacs.org::*environment][koishimacs.org:Prelude:environment]] to get ~ELPA~ mirror URLs, ~PATH~, ~http_proxy~ and other environment variables configured correctly.

   You may also want to configure ~org-directory~ and ~org-roam-directory~ at the same time, just search and modify these ~:custom~ cells in section [[file:koishimacs.org::*Org Editor][koishimacs.org:Org Editor]], it is not a difficult task.

   You can remove unwanted blocks easily by add ~:tangle no~ to it, or simply delete one ~use-package~ block. After all, ~git~ records it for you.

3. Then, you can try to start up koishimacs with:

   #+begin_src sh
     emacs --init-directory=/path/to/koishimacs
   #+end_src

   Now wait for about 3 to 5 minutes for package installation. If no problems arise, welcome!

4. Finally, do remaining steps to complete the installation. There is an untangled block at [[file:koishimacs.org::*postscript][koishimacs.org:postscript]] that does these things.

- Currently koishimacs uses [[https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/][DejaVu Fonts]] as its default font.
- There may be some external program dependencies, like ~ripgrep~, ~global~ or ~curl~. Most of them are not necessary for basic usage, install them on yourselves if you need.
- [[https://www.nerdfonts.com][nerd-fonts]] is highly recommended for display various icons. ~Symbols Nerd Font~ covers most Unicode icons used. As for Chinese font, the default Chinese font I use is ~LXGW Wenkai Mono~.

* Maintenance
The mainline code will keep updating on my personal taste, fork it if you could be inspired, to some degree. Do *NOT* pull it, it is not meant to have a contiguous integration process.

Feel free to discuss with me in Issues or E-mail, I am also active on Emacs China Forum, recently.
